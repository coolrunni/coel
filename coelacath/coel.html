        <div class="para1">
            <p>The primitive-looking coelacanth  was thought to have gone extinct with the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. But its discovery in 1938 by a South African museum curator on a local fishing trawler fascinated the world and ignited a debate about how this bizarre lobe-finned fish fits into the evolution of land animals.
            The coelacanths are members of a now-rare order of fish (Coelacanthiformes) that includes two extant species in the genus Latimeria: the West Indian Ocean coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) primarily found near the Comoro Islands off the east coast of Africa and the Indonesian coelacanth (Latimeria menadoensis). The name originates from the Permian genus Coelacanthus, which was the first scientifically named coelacanth. 
            Coelacanths follow the oldest-known living lineage of Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish and tetrapods), which means they are more closely related to lungfish and tetrapods (which includes amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals) than to ray-finned fish. They are found along the coastline of Indonesia and in the Indian Ocean. The West Indian Ocean coelacanth is a critically endangered species.
            Coelacanths belong to the subclass Actinistia, a group of lobed-finned fish related to lungfish and certain extinct Devonian fish such as osteolepiforms, porolepiforms, rhizodonts, and Panderichthys. Coelacanths were thought to have become extinct in the Late Cretaceous, around 66 million years ago, but were rediscovered in 1938 off the coast of South Africa. 
            The coelacanth was long considered a "living fossil" because scientists thought it was the sole remaining member of a taxon otherwise known only from fossils, with no close relations alive, and that it evolved into roughly its current form approximately 400 million years ago. However, several more recent studies have shown that coelacanth body shapes are much more diverse than previously thought.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="loca"> <p>There are only two known species of coelacanths: one that lives near the Comoros Islands off the east coast of Africa, and one found in the waters off Sulawesi, Indonesia. Many scientists believe that the unique characteristics of the coelacanth represent an early step in the evolution of fish to terrestrial four-legged animals like amphibians.

            Coelacanths are elusive, deep-sea creatures, living in depths up to 2,300 feet below the surface. They can be huge, reaching 6.5 feet or more and weighing 198 pounds. Scientists estimate they can live up to 60 years or more.

            Unique Characteristics
            The most striking feature of this "living fossil" is its paired lobe fins that extend away from its body like legs and move in an alternating pattern, like a trotting horse. Other unique characteristics include a hinged joint in the skull which allows the fish to widen its mouth for large prey; an oil-filled tube, called a notochord, which serves as a backbone; thick scales common only to extinct fish; and an electrosensory rostral organ in its snout likely used to detect prey</p></div>

                <p>According to genetic analysis of current species, the divergence of coelacanths, lungfish and tetrapods is thought to have occurred about 390 million years ago. Coelacanths were once thought to have become extinct 66 million years ago during the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event. The earliest identified coelacanth fossil, found in Australia, was of a jaw that dated back 360 million years, named Eoachtinistia foreyi. The most recent coelacanth in the fossil record is a fragmentary marine mawsoniid from the late Maastrichtian of Morocco. The youngest named species belong to two distinct lineages : the latimeriid Megalocoelacanthus dobiei, whose disarticulated remains are found in late Santonian to middle Campanian, and possibly earliest Maastrichtian-aged marine strata of the Eastern and Central United States, and the mawsoniid Axelrodichthys megadromos from early Campanian to early Maastrichtian continental deposits of France. The former lived in the Western Interior Seaway, while the latter lived in the lakes and rivers of the Ibero-Armorican island, an insular landmass made up of a large part of present-day France and Iberian peninsula. A small bone fragment from the European Paleocene has been considered the only plausible post-Cretaceous record, but this identification is based on comparative bone histology methods of doubtful reliability. Some extinct coelacanths reached very large sizes, with lengths between 3.5 metres (11 ft) and 6.3 metres (21 ft), such as the Jurassic genus Trachymetopon, the Cretaceous taxa Mawsoniaand Megalocoelacanthus, and an indeterminate mawsoniid from Morocco. Coelacanths were never a diverse group in comparison to other groups of fish, and reached a peak diversity during the Early Triassic (252-247 million years ago). 
                The fossil record is unique because coelacanth fossils were found 100 years before the first live specimen was identified. In 1938, Courtenay-Latimer rediscovered the first live specimen, L. chalumnae, caught off the coast of East London, South Africa. In 1997, a marine biologist on honeymoon discovered the second extant species, Latimeria menadoensis, in an Indonesian market.</p>
